This is the repositiory for our Final project for COP3530: Data Structures. We decided to build a
" Tune Match Maker " , which is a program that recommends new songs similar to a song searched 
on spotify utilizing graphs. 

To run the program just download the repositiory open up and run the main.cpp file in this file location: 
yourLocalDrive\SongEditorFinder\main.cpp
