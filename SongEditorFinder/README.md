This is the repositiory for our Final project for COP3530: Data Structures. We decided to build a
" Tune Match Maker " , which is a program that recommends new songs similar to a song searched 
on the, utilizing and returning the results from a breadth first search from two graph implementations, a EdjList and AdjMatrix. 

To run the program:
- download and configure SFML for your respective IDE
-  download the repositiory open up and run the main.cpp file in this file location: 
yourLocalDrive\SongEditorFinder\main.cpp
